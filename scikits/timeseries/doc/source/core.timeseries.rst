:class:`~TimeSeries` objects
============================

.. class:: TimeSeries

   A subclass of :class:`~numpy.ma.MaskedArray` designed to manipulate time series.

   :Parameters:
       **data** : {array_like}
           Data portion of the array.
           Any data that is valid for constructing a :class:`~numpy.ma.MaskedArray` can be used here:

           * a sequence of objects (numbers, characters, objects);
           * a :class:`~numpy.ndarray` or one of its subclass.
             In particular, :class:`~numpy.ma.MaskedArray` and :class:`TimeSeries` are recognized.

       **dates** : {DateArray}
           A :class:`DateArray` instance storing the date information.

       **autosort** : {True, False}, optional
           Whether to sort the series in chronological order.

       **\*\*optional_parameters** :
           All the parameters recognized by :class:`~numpy.ma.MaskedArray` are also recognized by :class:`TimeSeries`.

   .. seealso::
      :class:`~numpy.ma.MaskedArray`



A :class:`~TimeSeries` object is the combination of three ndarrays:

* :attr:`dates`: A :class:`~DateArray` object.
* :attr:`data` : A :class:`~numpy.ndarray`.
* :attr:`mask` : A boolean :class:`~numpy.ndarray`, indicating missing or invalid data.

These three arrays can be accessed as attributes of a :class:`~TimeSeries` object.
Another very useful attribute is :attr:`series`, that gives the possibility to directly access :attr:`data` and :attr:`mask` as a masked array.

As :class:`TimeSeries` objects subclass :class:`~numpy.ma.MaskedArray`, they inherit all their attributes and methods, as well as the attributes and methods of regular ndarrays.



Attributes
==========

... specific to :class:`TimeSeries`
-----------------------------------

   .. attribute:: data

      Returns a view of a :class:`TimeSeries` as a :class:`~numpy.ndarray`.
      This attribute is read-only and cannot be directly set.


   .. attribute:: mask

      Returns the mask of the object, as a :class:`~numpy.ndarray`
      with the same shape as :attr:`data`, or as the special value
      :data:`~numpy.ma.nomask` (equivalent to :const:`False`).
      This attribute is writable and can be modified.

      If :attr:`data` has a standard :attr:`~numpy.dtype` (no named fields),
      the :attr:`~numpy.dtype` of the mask is boolean.
      If :attr:`data` is a structured array with named fields, the mask
      has the same structure as the :attr:`data`\'s, but each field is
      atomically boolean.

      In any case, a value of :const:`True` in the mask indicates that the
      corresponding value of the series is invalid.

   .. attribute:: series

      Returns a view of a :class:`TimeSeries` as a :class:`~numpy.ma.MaskedArray`.
      This attribute is read-only and cannot be directly set


   .. attribute:: dates

      Returns the :class:`DateArray` object of the dates of the series.
      This attribute is writable and can be modified.
      However, the size of the array must be zero or match either the size of the series or its length.


   .. attribute:: varshape

      Returns the number of equivalent variables for each date.
      If ``varshape == ()``, the series has only one variable and is called a 1V-series.

Construction
============

To construct a :class:`~TimeSeries` object, the simplest method is to directly call the class constructor with the proper parameters.

However, the recommended way is to use the :func:`~time_series` factory function.

.. autofunction:: time_series


.. note::

   By default, the series is automatically sorted in chronological order.
   This behavior can be overwritten by setting the  keyword ``autosort=False``.



Dates and data compatibility
----------------------------

The simplest example of a :class:`TimeSeries` consists in a series ``series`` of one variable, where a date is associated with each element of the array.
In that case, the :attr:`dates` attribute is a :class:`DateArray` with the same size as the underlying array.

For example, we can create a 4-element series:

   >>> first_date = ts.Date('D', '2009-01-01')
   >>> series = ts.time_series([1, 2, 3, 4], start_date=first_date)
   >>> series
   timeseries([1 2 3 4],
      dates = [01-Jan-2009 ... 04-Jan-2009],
      freq  = D)

Note that with the use of the :keyword:`start_date` keyword,  the size
of the :attr:`dates` attribute is automatically adjusted by :func:`time_series`
to match the size of the input data.

The :attr:`dates` can now be modified in place.
For example, they can be shifted by one week with the following command.

   >>> series.dates +=7
   >>> series
   timeseries([1 2 3 4],
      dates = [08-Jan-2009 ... 11-Jan-2009],
      freq  = D)

The dates can also be changed by setting the :attr:`dates` attribute to another  :class:`DateArray` object.
In that case, the size of the new dates must match the size of the series, or a :exc:`TimeSeriesCompatibilityError` is raised.
Setting the :attr:`dates` attribute to an object of a different type raises a :exc:`TypeError` exception.


It is often convenient to manipulate a series of several variables at once.
Once possibility is to use a `structured array <http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.rec.html>`_ as input,
as illustrated by the following example:

   >>>  series = ts.time_series(zip(np.random.normal(0, 1, 10),
   ...                              np.random.uniform(0, 1, 10)),
   ...                          dtype=[('norm', float), ('unif', float)],
   ...                          start_date=ts.Date('D', '2001-01-01'))

In this example, ``series`` consists of two fields (`'norm'` and `'unif'`).
Note that in this example, the two fields have the same type (:class:`~numpy.float`), but this is not a requirement.
Each field can be accessed as an independent :class:`TimeSeries` using ``series['norm']`` and ``series['unif']``.

In practice, each individual entry of ``series`` is a :class:`numpy.void` object.
The series as a whole behaves as a 1D masked array, as represented by the :attr:`shape` of the series: ``series.shape = (10,)``.
Because ``series`` is a 1D array, the size of ``series.dates`` must match ``series.size``.

Despite the convenience of this approach to manipulate multi-variable series, it presents a serious disadvantage: structured arrays are usually not recognized by standard numpy functions.

An alternative is then to represent a series as a two-dimensional array, using  columns as variables and rows as actual obervations.
In that case, all the variables must have the same type, and the size of the :attr:`dates` attibute must match the length of the series.

More generally, it is possible to create a multi-variable series as a nD array.
The corresponding dates must then satisfy the condition ``series.dates.size == series.shape[0]`` or a :exc:`TimeSeriesCompatibilityError` is raised.
The specific attribute :attr:`varshape` is then set to keep track of the number of variables.


For example, a series of 50 years of monthly data can be represented as a (600,)-array of observations at a monthly frequency, or as a (50,12)-array of observations at an annual frequency.

   >>> start - ts.Date('M', '2001-01')
   >>> data = np.random.uniform(-1, +1, 50*12).reshape(50, 12)
   >>> mseries = ts.time_series(data, start_date=start, length=50*12)
   >>> aseries = ts.time_series(data, start_date=start.asfreq('Y'), length=50)

Both series have the same shape, ``(50, 12)``, but ``mseries`` is a series of one variable, with ``mseries.varshape == ()``, while ``aseries`` is a series of 12 variables, ``aseries.varshape == (12,)``, each variable corresponding to a month.

   >>> (mseries.shape, mseries.varshape)
   ((50, 12), ())
   >>> (aseries.shape, aseries.varshape)
   ((50, 12), (12,))

Because ``aseries`` is basically a 2D array, we can easily compute annual and monthly means.
Thus, monthly means over the whole 50 years can be calculated at once with the :meth:`~scikits.timeseries.mean` method, using ``axis=0`` as parameter.
We can also compute the equivalent of 50 years of annual data using :meth:`~scikits.timeseries.mean` method, this time with ``axis=1``.

   >>> amean = aseries.mean(axis=1)
   >>> amean.shape = (50,)
   >>> mmean = aseries.mean(axis=0)
   >>> mmean.shape = (12,)


Another example of multi-variable series would be one year of daily (256x256) raster map.
This dataset can easily be represented as a (365,256,256)-array, and a corresponding series created with the following code::

   >>> data = np.random.uniform(-1, +1, 365*256*256).reshape(365, 256, 256)
   >>> newseries = ts.time_series(data, start_date=ts.now('D'))
