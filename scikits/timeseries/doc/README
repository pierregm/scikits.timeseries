Building
--------

* On linux/unix systems, use the included makefile in this directory to build
  the docs.
* On windows systems, use make.py to build the docs.

Sphinx Extensions
-----------------

The directory sphinxext_numpy is a direct copy of the sphinxext directory from
the numpy doc directory. DO NOT modify files in this directory directly.

The directory sphinxext_ts contains extensions specific to the timeseries
module. Eventually we would like to eliminate this directory and use only the
numpy sphinx extensions.
